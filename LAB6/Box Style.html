    <p>
      Intramuros, also known as the "Walled City," is the oldest district in Manila.

      Its preserved walls, churches, and fortresses remain a symbol of the Philippines’ rich colonial history.

    <h2>Banaue Rice Terraces</h2>
    <p>
      The Banaue Rice Terraces, often called the "Eighth Wonder of the World," were carved into the mountains 
      of Ifugao by the ancestors of the indigenous people over 2,000 years ago. 
      These terraces showcase Filipino ingenuity and sustainable farming practices that continue to this day.
